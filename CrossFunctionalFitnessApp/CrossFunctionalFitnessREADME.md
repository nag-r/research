## Project Overview
This project is designed to introduce users to the world of CrossFunctional Fitness through a Java-based application. It provides various functionalities to track and analyze fitness routines, diets, and progress over time.

## How to Build and Run the Project

### Step 1: Prepare the Files
Copy the below 6 project files to a folder:

- `CrossFunctionalFitness.java`
- `NewUserProfile.java`
- `FitnessSummary.java`
- `FitnessMetricsCalculator.java`
- `WorkoutPlanGenerator.java`
- `WorkoutData.java`

The entry point of the application is located in the `CrossFunctionalFitness.java` file. This file contains the `main()` method which initiates the application.

### Step 2: Compile the Project
1. Open your command line interface (CLI), such as Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux.
2. Navigate to the directory where the 6 project files are located.
3. Compile the `CrossFunctionalFitness.java` file and other Java files in the project using the following command:
   ```
   javac CrossFunctionalFitness.java NewUserProfile.java FitnessSummary.java FitnessMetricsCalculator.java WorkoutPlanGenerator.java WorkoutData.java
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Application
1. After successful compilation, run the application using the following command:
   ```
   java CrossFunctionalFitness
   ```
2. This command will start the application, and the user interface should appear as designed.

**Note:** Ensure all Java files (`CrossFunctionalFitness.java`, `NewUserProfile.java`, `FitnessSummary.java`, `FitnessMetricsCalculator.java`, `WorkoutPlanGenerator.java`, `WorkoutData.java`) are in the same directory for smooth compilation and execution.
